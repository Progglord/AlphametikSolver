AlphametikSolver
================

Alphametiks are puzzles like
SEND+MORE=MONEY
where you have to replace every letter by a figure (0 to 9), in a way
that the equation is true.

This algorithm can solve alphametiks with any count of words and operators +, -, *, /.
The operator must stay the same, for example the alphametik SEND+MORE-MONEY=SOMETHING will
not be accepted whereas SEND+MORE+MONEY=SOMETHING or SEND-MORE-MONEY=SOMETHING would
be accepted.
